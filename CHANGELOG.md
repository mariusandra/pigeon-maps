## 0.14.0 - 2019-08-31
- React 16.8 support by removing deprecated componentWillReceiveProps and replacing it with componentDidUpdate. #70 @JoaquimEsteves

## 0.13.0 - 2019-05-09
- Add the `dprs` parameter to `<Map />` and `dpr` as the 4th argument for the `provider` functions.

Previously if you wanted to support HiDPI screens your `provider` function looked something like this:

```js
function wikimedia (x, y, z) {
  const retina = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.devicePixelRatio >= 2
  return `https://maps.wikimedia.org/osm-intl/${z}/${x}/${y}${retina ? '@2x' : ''}.png`
}
```

This works fine and will continue to work in `0.13`. However this had some issues with server rendering. The code on your server would always render the non-retina image and later React would hydrate it with the real retina image. This lead to a bit of flickering and to the loading of an excessive amount of map tiles.

Now you can pass `<Map dprs={[1, 2]} />` and update your provider function to:

```js
function wikimedia (x, y, z, dpr) {
  return `https://maps.wikimedia.org/osm-intl/${z}/${x}/${y}${dpr >= 2 ? '@2x' : ''}.png`
}
```

... and pigeon-maps will call the provider twice to create a `<img srcset>` for both resolutions.

The value of `dpr` will be `undefined` for the default tile (`<img src>`) which acts as a backup for older browsers.

If you don't need server rendering, then the old approach of having no `dprs` array and figuring out the `dpr` from the `window` inside `provider` will continue to work fine.

## 0.12.1 - 2019-03-26
- Fix 100% height issue. #48 and #4

## 0.12.0 - 2019-03-26
- Removed inferno support, which reportedly didn't even work (#39).
- Started using rollup and babel loose mode to reduce the size even more. #59 @markusenglund (a [~8% reduction!](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=pigeon-maps@0.12.0))

## 0.11.11 - 2018-11-16
- Fix wheel/touchpad scrolling on Chrome 73+, which requires non-passive event handlers for wheel events. [See also this](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14856).

## 0.11.8 - 2018-11-16
- Another edge case bug with animation and changing the center before the animation had time to finish.

## 0.11.7 - 2018-11-16
- Bug when animating between screens and forced to jump to a far away screen, it would freeze instead of jumping.

## 0.11.6 - 2018-11-05
- The `pigeon-drag-block` class also works with touch events

## 0.11.5 - 2018-10-18
- Fixes "0 0 0 0" appearing if the map has no size. #46 @PofMagicfingers

## 0.11.4 - 2018-10-18

- Fix bug zoom position when browser loses focus #41 @benrampon

## 0.11.1 - 2018-09-29

## 0.11.0 - 2018-09-19
- Added `minZoom` and `maxZoom` to limit the zoom range
- Several small bugfixes

## 0.10.0 - 2018-09-10
### New updates
- `width` and `height` can now be omitted to force the component to 100% of the parent container
- `defaultWidth` and `defaultHeight` are added to specify a placeholder width/height for the initial render and server rendering
- `mouseEvents` and `touchEvents` can be used to enable/disable mouse and touch events completely
- `animateMaxScreens` specifies how far must a change to `center` be before we stop smoothly animating to it
- `twoFingerDrag` and `twoFingerDragWarning` can be used to block dragging the map with one finger
- `onAnimationStart` and `onAnimationEnd` callbacks notify us if the map is moving or not

### Breaking changes
- `zoomSnap` is now enabled by default
- `metaWheelZoom` replaces `zoomOnMouseWheel` andÂ is reversed (previous `false` is now `true`)
- `metaWheelZoomWarning` replaces `mouseWheelMetaText`

### Other changes
- There have been numerous bug fixes since the `0.9` series, too many to mention all now
